# SIMPlex

This repository contains the code used to generate the figures for the SIMPlex manuscript, as well as the code used for overall analysis of single-nuclei and Visium data. The code 
for the figures can be found in the `figures` directory (`main` for the main figures, `supplementary` for the supplementary figures), and the code for the analysis can be found in 
the `analysis` directory.
