# SIMPlex

This repository contains the code used to generate the figures for the SIMPlex manuscript, including code for analysis of single-nuclei and Visium data. The code 
for the figures can be found in the `main` directory, and the code for the supplements is in the `supplementary` 
directory. Supplementary figures without a dedicated R Markdown file are generated with the main 
figures and the code for those are in the relevant `main`.
